     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               Tux Paint Config.

     As of Tux Paint version 0.9.14, a graphical tool is available that
     allows you to change Tux Paint's behavior. However, if you'd rather not
     install and use this tool, or want a better understanding of the
     available options, please continue reading.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               Configuration File

     You can create a simple configuration file for Tux Paint, which it will
     read each time you start it up.

     The file is simply a plain text file containing the options you want
     enabled:

Linux and Unix Users

       The file you should create is called ".tuxpaintrc" and it should be
       placed in your home directory. (a.k.a. "~/.tuxpaintrc" or
       "$HOME/.tuxpaintrc")

  System-Wide Configuration File

         Before this file is read, a system-wide configuration file is read.
         (By default, this configuration has no settings enabled.) It is
         located at:

           /etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf

         You can disable reading of this file altogether, leaving the
         settings as defaults (which can then be overridden by your
         ".tuxpaintrc" file and/or command-line arguments) by using the
         command-line option:

           --nosysconfig

Mac OS X Users

       The file you should create is called "tuxpaint.cfg" and it should be
       placed in your home folder, under the sub-folder: Library/Application
       Support/TuxPaint

  System-Wide Configuration File

         Before this file is read, a system-wide configuration file is read.
         (By default, this configuration has no settings enabled.) It is
         located at:

           /Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/tuxpaint.cfg

Windows Users

         The file you should create is called "tuxpaint.cfg" and it should be
         placed in Tux Paint's folder.

         You can use NotePad or WordPad to create this file. Be sure to save
         it as Plain Text, and make sure the filename doesn't have ".txt" at
         the end...

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                               Available Options

       The following settings can be set in the configuration file.
       (Command-line settings will override these. See the "Command-Line
       Options" section, below.)

       fullscreen=yes
               Run the program in full screen mode, rather than in a window.

       fullscreen=native
               Run the program in full screen mode. Additionally, assume the
               screen's current resolution (set by the operating system).

       windowsize=SIZE

               Run the program at a different size (in windowed mode) or at a
               different screen resolution (in fullscreen mode), rather than
               the default (usually 800x600).

               The SIZE value should be presented in pixels, in
               'width-by-height' format, with an "x" (lowercase X) between
               the values. The size can be anything that's at least 640 wide,
               and at least 480 tall.

               Some examples:
                  * 640x480
                  * 1024x768
                  * 768x1024
                  * 1600x1200

       orient=portrait

               Swaps the width/height options given to Tux Paint, useful for
               rotating the window on portait displays, such as a tablet PC
               that's in tablet orientation.

       native=yes

               When running Tux Paint in fullscreen mode, this assumes the
               screen's current resolution (overriding any "windowsize"
               option), as set by the operating system.

       allowscreensaver=yes

               By default, Tux Paint prevents your system's screensaver from
               starting up. You can override this by using the
               "allowscreensaver" option. Note: This requires version 1.2.12
               or higher of the SDL library. (You can also do this by setting
               the "SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER" environment variable on your
               system to "1".)

       nosound=yes
               Disable sound effects. (Note: Pressing [Alt] + [S] cannot be
               used to reenable sounds if they were disabled using this
               option.)

       noquit=yes

               Disable the on-screen "Quit" button and prevent the [Escape]
               key from quitting Tux Paint.

               Using the [Alt] + [F4] keyboard combination or clicking the
               window's close button (assuming you're not in fullscreen mode)
               still works to quit Tux Paint.

               You can also use the following keyboard combination to quit:
               [Shift] + [Control] + [Escape].

       noprint=yes
               Disable the printing feature.

       printdelay=SECONDS
               Restrict printing so that printing can occur only once every
               SECONDS seconds.

       printcommand=COMMAND

               (Linux and Unix only)

               Use the command COMMAND to print a PostScript format file when
               the 'Print' button is clicked. If this option is not
               specifically not set, the default command is:

                 lpr

               Note: Versions of Tux Paint prior to 0.9.15 sent PNG format
               data to the print command (which defaulted to
               "pngtopnm | pnmtops | lpr").

               If you set an alternative printcommand in the configuration
               file prior to version 0.9.15, you will need to change it.

       altprintcommand=COMMAND

               (Linux and Unix only)

               Use the command COMMAND to print a PostScript format file when
               the 'Print' button is clicked while the [Alt] modifier key is
               being held. (This is typically used for providing a print
               dialog, similar to when pressing [Alt]+'Print' in Windows and
               Mac OS X.)

               If this option is not specifically not set, the default
               command is KDE's graphical print dialog:

                 kprinter

       printcfg=yes

               (Windows and Mac OS X only)

               Tux Paint will use a printer configuration file when printing.
               Push the [Alt] key while clicking the 'Print' button in
               Tux Paint to cause a Windows print dialog window to appear.

               (Note: This only works when not running Tux Paint in
               fullscreen mode.) Any configuration changes made in this
               dialog will be saved to the file "userdata/print.cfg", and
               used again, as long as the "printcfg" option is set.

       altprint=always

               This causes Tux Paint to always show the printer dialog (or,
               on Linux/Unix, run the "altprintcommand") when the 'Print'
               button is clicked. In other words, it's like clicking 'Print'
               while holding [Alt], except you don't need to hold [Alt] every
               time.

       altprint=never

               This prevents Tux Paint from ever showing the printer dialog
               (or, on Linux/Unix, run the "altprintcommand") when the
               'Print' button is clicked. In other words, it makes the [Alt]
               key have no effect when clicking the 'Print' button.

       altprint=mod

               This is the normal, default behavior. Tux Paint shows a
               printer dialog (or, on Linux/Unix, runs the
               "altprintcommand"), when the [Alt] key is pressed while the
               'Print' button is clicked. Clicking 'Print' without holding
               [Alt] prints without showing a dialog.

       papersize=PAPERSIZE

               (Platforms that use Tux Paint's internal PostScript generator
               - not Windows, Mac OS X or BeOS.)

               Tell Tux Paint what size PostScript to generate. If none is
               specified, Tux Paint first checks your $PAPER environment
               variable, then the file /etc/papersize, then uses the the
               'libpaper' library's default paper size.

               Valid paper sizes include: letter, legal, tabloid, executive,
               note, statement, a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10,
               b0, b1, b2 b3, b4, 10x14, 11x17, halfletter, halfexecutive,
               halfnote, folio, quarto, ledger, archA, archB, archC, archD,
               archE, flsa, flse, csheet, dsheet, esheet.

       nolockfile=yes

               By default, Tux Paint uses what's known as a 'lockfile' to
               prevent it from being launched more than once in 30 seconds.
               (This is to avoid accidentally running multiple copies; for
               example, by double-clicking a single-click launcher, or simply
               impatiently clicking the icon multiple times.)

               To make Tux Paint ignore the lockfile, allowing it to run
               again, even if it was just launched less than 30 seconds ago,
               enable this setting in the configuration file, or run
               Tux Paint with the '--nolockfile' option on the command-line.

               By default, the lockfile is stored in "~/.tuxpaint/" under
               Linux and Unix, and "userdata\" under Windows.

       simpleshapes=yes
               Disable the rotation step of the 'Shape' tool. Click, drag and
               release is all that will be needed to draw a shape.

       uppercase=yes
               All text will be rendered only in uppercase (e.g., "Brush"
               will be "BRUSH"). Useful for children who can read, but who
               have only learned uppercase letters so far.

       grab=yes

               Tux Paint will attempt to 'grab' the mouse and keyboard, so
               that the mouse is confined to Tux Paint's window, and nearly
               all keyboard input is passed directly to it.

               This is useful to disable operating system actions that could
               get the user out of Tux Paint [Alt]-[Tab] window cycling,
               [Ctrl]-[Escape], etc. This is especially useful in fullscreen
               mode.

       noshortcuts=yes

               This disable keyboard shortcuts (e.g., [Ctrl]-[S] for save,
               [Ctrl]-[N] for a new image, etc.)

               This is useful to prevent unwanted commands from being
               activated by children who aren't experienced with keyboards.

       nowheelmouse=yes
               This disables support for the wheel on mice that have it.
               (Normally, the wheel will scroll the selector menu on the
               right.)

       nobuttondistinction=yes

               Prior to Tux Paint 0.9.15, the middle and right buttons on a
               mouse could also be used for clicking. In version 0.9.15, it
               was changed so that only the left mouse button worked, so as
               to not train children to use the wrong button.

               However, for children who have trouble with the mouse, this
               distinction between the two or three buttons on a mouse can be
               disabled (returning Tux Paint to its old behavior) by using
               this option.

       nofancycursors=yes

               This disables the fancy mouse pointer shapes in Tux Paint, and
               uses your environment's normal mouse pointer.

               In some enviornments, the fancy cursors cause problems. Use
               this option to avoid them.

       hidecursor=yes

               This completely hides the mouse pointer shapes in Tux Paint.

               This is useful for touchscreen devices, such as tablet PCs.

       nooutlines=yes

               In this mode, much simpler outlines and 'rubber-band' lines
               are displayed when using the Lines, Shapes, Stamps and Eraser
               tools.

               This can help when Tux Paint is run on very slow computers, or
               displayed on a remote X-Window display.

       sysfonts=yes

               This option causes Tux Paint to attempt to load fonts (for use
               in the Text tool) from your operating system. Normally,
               Tux Paint will only load the ones that came bundled with
               Tux Paint.

       alllocalefonts=yes

               Prior to version 0.9.21, Tux Paint loaded all fonts in its own
               fonts directory, including locale-specific ones (e.g., the one
               for Tibetan, which had no latin characters). As of 0.9.21, the
               only font loaded from the locale-specific subdirectory, if
               any, is one matching the locale Tux Paint is running on.

               To load all locale-specific fonts (the old behavior), set this
               option.

       nostamps=yes

               This option tells Tux Paint to not load any rubber stamp
               images, which in turn ends up disabling the Stamps tool.

               This can speed up Tux Paint when it first loads up, and reduce
               memory usage while it's running. Of course, no stamps will be
               available at all.

       nostampcontrols=yes
               Some images in the Stamps tool can be mirrored, flipped,
               and/or have their size changed. This option disables the
               controls, and only provides the basic stamps.

       nomagiccontrols=yes
               Some Magic tools have the option of acting like a paintbrush,
               or affecting the entire canvas at once. This option disables
               the controls, and only provides the default functionality
               (usually paint-mode).

       mirrorstamps=yes

               For stamps that can be mirrored, this option sets them to
               their mirrored shape by default.

               This can be useful for people who prefer things right-to-left,
               rather than left-to-right.

       stampsize=SIZE

               Use this option to force Tux Paint to set the starting size of
               all stamps. The SIZE value should be between 0 (smallest) and
               10 (largest). The size is relative to the available sizes of
               the stamp, which depends on the stamp itself, and Tux Paint's
               current canvas size.

               Specifc "default" to let Tux Paint decide (it's standard
               behavior).

       keyboard=yes

               This allows the keyboard arrow keys to be used to control the
               mouse pointer. (e.g., for mouseless environments.)

               The [Arrow] keys move the mouse pointer. [Space] acts as the
               mouse button.

       savedir=DIRECTORY

               Use this option to change where Tux Paint's "saved"
               directory/folder is located, which is where Tux Paint saves
               and opens pictures.

               If you do not override it, the default location is:
                  * Linux & Unix - Under a hidden directory named ".tuxpaint"
                    in your home directory (aka "~" or "$HOME")
                    Example: "/home/username/.tuxpaint/saved/"

                  * Windows - Inside a folder named "TuxPaint" in your
                    "Application Data" folder.
                    Example:
                    "C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application Data\TuxPaint\saved\"

                  * Mac OS X - Inside a folder named "TuxPaint" in your
                    "Application Support" folder.
                    Example:
                    "/Users/Username/Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/saved/"

               Note: When specifying a Windows drive (e.g., "H:\"), you must
               also specify a subdirectory.

               Note: Prior to version 0.9.18, Tux Paint would also use the
               setting or default for "savedir" as the place to search for
               personal data files (brushes, stamps, starters and fonts). As
               of version 0.9.18, they may be specified separately (see the
               "datadir" option, below).

               Example: savedir=Z:\tuxpaint\

       datadir=DIRECTORY

               Use this option to change where Tux Paint looks for personal
               data files (brushes, stamps, starters and fonts specific to
               the current user).

               Tux Paint will search for subdirectories/subfolders named
               "brushes", "stamps", "starters" and "fonts" under the data
               directory.

               If you do not override it, the default location is:
                  * Linux & Unix - Under a hidden directory named ".tuxpaint"
                    in your home directory (aka "~" or "$HOME")
                    Example: "/home/username/.tuxpaint/brushes/"

                  * Windows - Inside a folder named "TuxPaint" in your
                    "Application Data" folder.
                    Example:
                    "C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application Data\TuxPaint\brushes\"

                  * Mac OS X - Inside a folder named "TuxPaint" in your
                    "Application Support" folder.
                    Example:
                    "/Users/Username/Library/Application Support/TuxPaint/brushes/"

               Note: Prior to version 0.9.18, Tux Paint would use the same
               setting or default as for "savedir" to search for data files.
               As of version 0.9.18, they may be specified separately.

               Note: When specifying a Windows drive (e.g., "H:\"), you must
               also specify a subdirectory.

               Example: datadir=/home/johnny/tuxpaint-data/

       saveover=yes
               This disables the "Save over the old version...?" prompt when
               saving an existing file. With this option, the older version
               will always be replaced by the new version, automatically.

       saveover=new
               This also disables the "Save over the old version...?" prompt
               when saving an existing file. This option, however, will
               always save a new file, rather than overwrite the older
               version.

       saveover=ask

               (This option is redundant, since this is the default.)

               When saving an existing drawing, you will be first asked
               whether to save over the older version or not.

       nosave=yes
               This disables Tux Paint's ability to save files (and therefore
               disables the on-screen "Save" button). It can be used in
               situations where the program is only being used for fun, or in
               a test environment.

       autosave=yes
               This prevents Tux Paint from asking whether you want to save
               the current picture when quitting, and assumes you do.

       startblank=yes
               This causes Tux Paint to display a blank canvas when it first
               starts up, rather than loading the last image that was being
               edited.

       colorfile=FILENAME

               You may override Tux Paint's default color palette by creating
               a plain ASCII text file that describes the colors you want,
               and pointing to that file using the colorfile option.

               The file should list one color per line. Colors are defined in
               terms of their Red, Green and Blue values, each from 0 (off)
               to 255 (brightest). (For more information, try Wikipedia's
               "RGB color model" article.)

               Colors may be listed using three decimal numbers (e.g.,
               "255 68 136") or a 6- or 3-digit-long hexadecimal 'triplet'
               (e.g., "#ff4488" or "#F48").

               After the color definition (on the same line) you may enter
               text to describe the color. Tux will display this text when
               the color is clicked. (For example, "#FFF White as snow.")

               As an example, you can see the default colors currently used
               in Tux Paint in: "default_colors.txt".

               NOTES: You must separate decimal values with spaces, and begin
               hexadecimal values with a pound/number-sign character ("#").
               In 3-digit hexadecimal, each digit is used for both the high
               and low halves of the byte, so "#FFF" is the same as
               "#FFFFFF", not "#F0F0F0".

              Overriding System Config. Options using .tuxpaintrc

       (For Linux and Unix users)

       If any of the above options are set in
       "/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.config", you can override them in your own
       "~/.tuxpaintrc" file.

       For true/false options, like "noprint" and "grab", you can simply say
       they equal 'no' in your "~/.tuxpaintrc" file:

         noprint=no
         uppercase=no

       Or, you can use options similar to the command-line override options
       described below. For example:

         print=yes
         mixedcase=yes

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                              Command-Line Options

       Options can also be issued on the command-line when you start
       Tux Paint.

         --autosave
         --lang LANGUAGE
         --colorfile FILE
                 These enable or correspond to the configuration file options
                 described above.

                     -------------------------------------

         --mouse
         --saveoverask
         --save
         --noautosave
                 These options can be used to override any settings made in
                 the configuration file. (If the option isn't set in the
                 configuration file(s), no overriding option is necessary.)

                     -------------------------------------

         --locale LOCALE

                 Run Tux Paint in one of the support languages. See the
                 "Choosing a Different Language" section below for the locale
                 strings (e.g., "de_DE" for German) to use.

                 (If your locale is already set, e.g. with the "$LANG"
                 environment variable, this option is not necessary, since
                 Tux Paint honors your environment's setting, if possible.)

         --nosysconfig

                 Under Linux and Unix, this prevents the system-wide
                 configuration file, "/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf", from
                 being read.

                 Only your own configuration file, "~/.tuxpaintrc", if it
                 exists, will be used.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Command-Line Informational Options

         The following options display some informative text on the screen.
         Tux Paint doesn't actually start up and run afterwards, however.

           --version
           --verbose-version
                   Display the version number and date of the copy of
                   Tux Paint you are running. The "--verbose-version" also
                   lists what compile-time options were set. (See INSTALL.txt
                   and FAQ.txt).

           --copying
                   Show brief license information about copying Tux Paint.

           --usage
                   Display the list of available command-line options.

           --help
                   Display brief help on using Tux Paint.

           --lang help
                   Display a list of available languages in Tux Paint.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                         Choosing a Different Language

       Tux Paint has been translated into a number of languages. To access
       the translations, you can use the "--lang" option on the command-line
       to set the language (e.g. "--lang spanish") or use the "lang=" setting
       in the configuration file (e.g., "lang=spanish").

       Tux Paint also honors your environment's current locale. (You can
       override it on the command-line using the "--locale" option; see
       above.)

       Use the option "--lang help" to list the available language options
       available.

         (*) - These languages require their own fonts, since they are not
         represented using a Latin character set, like the others. See the
         "Special Fonts" section, below.

         Note: Tux Paint provides an alternative input method for entering
         characters with the Text tool in some locales. The key comibation(s)
         listed can be used to cycle through the supported input methods
         while the Text tool is active.

Setting Your Environment's Locale

         Changing your locale will affect much of your environment.

         As stated above, along with letting you choose the language at
         runtime using command-line options ("--lang" and "--locale"),
         Tux Paint honors the global locale setting in your environment.

         If you haven't already set your environment's locale, the following
         will briefly explain how:

  Linux/Unix Users

           First, be sure the locale you want to use is enabled by editing
           the file "/etc/locale.gen" on your system and then running the
           program "locale-gen" as root.

           Note: Debian users may be able to simply run the command
           "dpkg-reconfigure locales" as root to bring up a configuration
           dialog. Ubuntu users may be able to run
           "sudo dpkg-reconfigure localeconf" (the "localeconf" package may
           need to be installed first), or may need to edit the file
           "/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local" first, and add locales they
           want, from the list found in "/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED".

           Then, before running Tux Paint, set your "$LANG" environment
           variable to one of the locales listed above. (If you want all
           programs that can be translated to be, you may wish to place the
           following in your login script; e.g. ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc,
           ~/.cshrc, etc.)

           For example, in a Bourne Shell (like BASH):

             export LANG=es_ES ; \
             tuxpaint

           And in a C Shell (like TCSH):

             setenv LANG es_ES ; \
             tuxpaint

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Windows Users

           Tux Paint will recognize the current locale and use the
           appropriate files by default. So this section is only for people
           trying different languages.

           The simplest thing to do is to use the '--lang' switch in the
           shortcut (see "INSTALL.txt"). However, by using an MSDOS Prompt
           window, it is also possible to issue a command like this:

             set LANG=es_ES

           ...which will set the language for the lifetime of that DOS
           window.

           For something more permanent, try editing your computer's
           'autoexec.bat' file using Windows' "sysedit" tool:

        Windows 95/98

            1. Click on the 'Start' button, and select 'Run...'.
            2. Type "sysedit" into the 'Open:' box (with or without quotes).
            3. Click 'OK'.
            4. Locate the AUTOEXEC.BAT window in the System Configuration
               Editor.
            5. Add the following at the bottom of the file:

                 set LANG=es_ES

            6. Close the System Configuration Editor, answering yes to save
               the changes.
            7. Restart your machine.

             To affect the entire machine, and all applications, it is
             possible to use the "Regional Settings" control panel:

            1. Click on the 'Start' button, and select
               'Settings | Control Panel'.
            2. Double click on the "Regional Settings" globe.
            3. Select a language/region from the drop down list.
            4. Click 'OK'.
            5. Restart your machine when prompted.

  Special Fonts

         Some languages require special fonts be installed. These font files
         (which are in TrueType format (TTF)), are much too large to include
         with the Tux Paint download, and are available separately. (See the
         table above, under the "Choosing a Different Language" section.)

         Note: As of version 0.9.18, Tux Paint uses the "SDL_Pango" library,
         which utilizes the "Pango" library to render text in the user
         interface, rather than using "SDL_ttf" directly. Unless your copy of
         Tux Paint was built without Pango support, special fonts should no
         longer be necessary.

         When running Tux Paint in a language that requires its own font,
         Tux Paint will try to load the font file from its system-wide
         "fonts" directory (under a "locale" subdirectory). The name of the
         file corresponds to the first two letters in the 'locale' code of
         the language (e.g., "ko" for Korean, "ja" for Japanese, "zh_tw" for
         Traditional Chinese).

         For example, under Linux or Unix, when Tux Paint is run in Korean
         (e.g., with the option "--lang korean"), Tux Paint will attempt to
         load the following font file:

           /usr/share/tuxpaint/fonts/locale/ko.ttf

         You can download fonts for supported languages from Tux Paint's
         website, http://www.tuxpaint.org/. (Look in the 'Fonts' section
         under 'Download.')

         Under Unix and Linux, you can use the Makefile that comes with the
         font to install the font in the appropriate location.
